###Snapchat Google Play popup remover thingiemajig


####Disclaimer
To make this easy: No one should probably never use anything I make, ever.<br>
This was made for me, I know it works sufficiently on my own device; I'm not responsible for yours.


####Description

Are you paranoid, but not paranoid enough to not want to send naked pictures to your friends and everyone at TeamSnapchat? Then this is the app for you!<br>
If you have an Android phone without GApps (that's Google Apps for you n00bz out there), and decided to sideload Snapchat, then you're probably all to familiar with this ruining your amazingly stunning poses like this one --><br>
Well, here's an abominable solution to your troubles: SNAPCHAT GOOGLE PLAY POPUP REMOVER!!! (Sexy name, right?)<br>
This Xposed module actually tricks your Snapchat app into thinking that you have Google Play Services on your phone, probably resulting a whole heap of underlying issues, but who gives a fuck, right?<br>
Have fun!


####Installation
Like I briefly mentioned already, this is an Xposed module, which means you need the Xposed Framework for it to work.<br>
If you don't have it up and running on your device already, head on over to [the Xposed subforum of XDA Developers](http://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed) and do your homework.<br>
After that you should be good to go, provided I ever upload the apk.<br>
To build it, I believe you need to add [the appropriate XposedBridge jar](http://forum.xda-developers.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=3164199&d=1423860398) as a library, which is sort of explained [here](https://github.com/rovo89/XposedBridge/wiki/Development-tutorial#xposedbridgeapijar).<br>
I'm not all too pedagogic, so you know, good luck and have fun.
Oh, and I used Android Studio.. So there's that.


####Compatibility
The short answer: No idea, but it works.<br>
My device is a OnePlus One running the CyanogenMod 12 (Android 5.0.2) nightlies and Snapchat 9.1.2.0.<br>
I don't see why it shouldn't work with any version of anything as long as it runs Xposed, but what do I know.<br>
The thing that might mess everything up could be the Snapchat version, so if you accidentally update yours (not sure how one would accidentally sideload an apk, but oh well), let me know and I'll send you a working version, maybe.
